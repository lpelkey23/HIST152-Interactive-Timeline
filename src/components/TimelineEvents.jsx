        'In 1888, Nikola Tesla patented the AC induction motor, a design that allowed electricity to be transmitted over long distances. Unlike earlier systems, AC could power homes and factories far from power plants.\n\nThis invention laid the groundwork for modern electrical grids. It helped bring power to rural areas and shaped the way energy is delivered to this day.',
